#  Name:
#     dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis

#  Purpose:
#     A MAKEMAP configuration suitable for bright isolated compact sources .

#  Description:
#     This file provides values for parameters used by the SMURF:MAKEMAP
#     command to control the details of the map-making algorithm. To
#     use it, assign it to the CONFIG parameter on the command line when
#     running MAKEMAP. For instance:
#
#     % makemap config=^/star/share/smurf/dimmconfig_bright_compact.lis
#
#     (substitute the path to your Starlink installation in place of
#     "/star").
#
#     The strategy provided by this configuration is aimed at short scans
#     of calibrators (which may be quite bright). We constrain the map
#     using ast.zero_circle=(0.01666), which sets all pixels beyond 60
#     arcsec to zero until the last iteration.  A word of warning: if
#     the source is near the edge of the map (or has an extent large than
#     the size of this mask!) this configuration may give odd results due
#     to the value of ast.zero_lowhits!  If you suspect a problem, compare
#     the location of the source with the zero-masked pixels (see QUALITY
#     component of the resulting map). If the mask overlaps with the source,
#     try modifying the radius.

#  Notes:
#     - This file inherits the parameter values defined in hidden file
#     /star/share/smurf/.dimmconfig_bright.lis (note the dot at the start
#     of the file name).
#     - For a full list of all available parameters, and their purposes,
#     see the file $SMURF_DIR/smurf_makemap.def. All available parameters
#     are also documented in SUN/258, appendix "Configuration Parameters".
#     - A single parameter can be given different values to use when
#     processing 450 or 850 um data. This is done by including the
#     parameter twice, prefixing the parameter name with "450." and "850."
